# MultipleAccLounge

##A rework of "14k"´s Chrome extension for Firefox
[His Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csgo-lounge-multiple-acco/iphkofafppppgihimdikacclfepeodme)

I remade it to fit into Firefox via GreaseMonkey ( also TamperMonkey for Chrome ).

##But its not that much work
  Yea but i couldn´t find anything about it on the Internet ( that there was something for Firefox ), so i "converted" it.
